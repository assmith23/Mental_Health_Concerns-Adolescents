# Mental_Health_Concerns-Adolescents

## Abstract

### Aim
This study aimed to explore social, family, and personal factors influencing mental health concerns (MHC) and associated relationships, among youth aged 6-17 using the 2022 National Survey of Children's Health dataset.

### Methods
The analysis utilized a various number of statistical approaches including logistic regression models, random forest classification, gradient boosting machines (GBM), and principal component analysis (PCA). Over 20 independent variables were identified as factors for analysis to be examined as potential risk factors. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were al;l used to gauge model performance.

### Results
With accuracies over 80% and reaching a peak of 84.6%, the different machine learning models indicated strong predictive performance. The main predictors were gender, degree of physical activity, involvement in after-school activities, and bullying experiences. Significant correlations between higher levels of physical exercise and after-school involvement and less mental health issues were found using logistic regression models. On the other hand, there was a clear correlation between heightened mental health issues and experiences of bullying and prejudice. These behavioral and social characteristics were consistently found to be the main predictors by variable importance analysis across several models.

### Conclusion
By highlighting the characteristics of mental health issues and identifying important risk variables, this study contributed to our understanding of teenage mental health. The results highlight the value of our many strategies for promoting physical exercise, social interaction through planned events, and anti-bullying measures in promoting the mental health of adolescents. The models' high predictive performance points to the possibility of creating instruments to identify people who are at risk.
